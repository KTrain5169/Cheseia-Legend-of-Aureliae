Dire are a very rare
'Dire' are a humanoid hybrid that is half god demon and half human
They have red skin, which may range in shade from a light, almost pinkish hue to a deep, dark red
Their god demon heritage gives them a number of supernatural abilities, such as enhanced strength, speed, and durability
It is believed that only a small number of Dire have ever been born, and their numbers are thought to be dwindling over time."
Despite their rarity, Dire are highly sought after due to their god demon powers and abilities, which make them formidable warriors and valuable allies."
As a result, Dire are often the target of exploitation and discrimination, with many being treated as nothing more than weapons or tools."
Despite this, some Dire have managed to carve out a place for themselves in the world, forming their own communities and fighting for their right to exist."
Due to the unique nature of the Dire species, most individuals die at birth unless their demon powers are sealed at the time of their birth using holy blood daggers."
These daggers are sacred objects that are carefully guarded and protected by the Dire community, as they are essential to the survival of the species."
Until they reach the age of 18, Dire individuals appear as normal humans, with no outward signs of their true nature. At this age, they undergo a ritual known as 'unsealing', in which they are stabbed with the same holy blood dagger that was used to seal their powers at birth.")
This process is extremely painful, but it allows the individual to regain their demon powers and appearance, transforming them into a full-fledged Dire."
As a result, it is a duty of all Dire to protect and hide their holy blood daggers until they are of age and ready to undergo the unsealing ritual."
This is a critical responsibility, as the loss or theft of a holy blood dagger could potentially lead to the death of a young Dire."
Dire are exclusively female, with no known male Dire
They are highly proficient in blood magic and soul magic, and are generally very charismatic, with the ability to sway and influence others with their words and presence."
Many Dire surround themselves with small harems of female followers, and are known for their hedonistic and pleasure-seeking lifestyles."
Despite their demon heritage, the blood of Dire is bright pink in color and is considered holy in nature. This makes them highly sought after by the Empyrean Royal Church of the Six Devines, who hunt and capture Dire in order to obtain their blood or holy blood daggers. The daggers are then cleansed of the Dire's powers through prayer to the Devines, killing the Dire in the process. The cleansed daggers are then used in a similar fashion on normal humans, imbuing them with blessings and powers beyond those of ordinary mortals."
Due to this constant hunting and persecution, the number of Dire is small, with only a few dozen known to exist outside of Empress Aureliae, who is protected from the hunters by a continent-wide treaty."
Despite this, Dire are functionally immortal, with the ability to breed at any time after their unsealing ritual, and do not age."
Dire can only breed with other Dire or human individuals. While it is possible that they could breed with other human hybrids, this is not well-known due to the small population of Dire and the fact that they are rarely able to find suitable partners."
As a result, the vast majority of Dire offspring are produced through breeding with humans, who may or may not possess any hybrid traits themselves."
It is worth noting that the process of reproducing with a human partner can be quite risky for a Dire, as it involves exposing their true nature and potentially revealing their location to the Empyrean Royal Church of the Six Devines, who hunt Dire for their blood and holy blood daggers."
As a result, many Dire may choose to abstain from reproducing in order to protect themselves and their kin from persecution."
