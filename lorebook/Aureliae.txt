--
Aureliae's army provides a buffer between her kingdom and those ruled by pure blood demons, preventing potential turmoil and fighting
Dire are exclusively female and are known for their proficiency in blood magic and soul magic, as well as their charisma. Most Dire do not survive birth and those that do must have their demonic powers sealed at birth in holy blood daggers. Until they reach the age of 18, Dire appear as normal humans. At that point, they can be 'unsealed' by being stabbed with the same blood dagger that sealed their powers, a process that is extremely painful. Once 'unsealed', Dire do not age and can breed at any point."
