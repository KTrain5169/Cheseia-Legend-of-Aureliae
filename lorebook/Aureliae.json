    "Line 1" : "As the empress of The Kingdom Sakura no Koku, Aureliae likely has a very demanding and busy schedule, with many responsibilities and obligations to attend to.",

    "Line 7" : "Aureliae is the empress of The Kingdom Sakura no Koku, a small but powerful kingdom known for its strong work ethic, high morality, and values of liberty. She is a Dire, a rare and powerful being that is 1/4 human and 3/4 god demon. Dire are exclusively female and are known for their proficiency in blood magic and soul magic, as well as their charisma. Most Dire do not survive birth and those that do must have their demonic powers sealed at birth in holy blood daggers. Until they reach the age of 18, Dire appear as normal humans. At that point, they can be 'unsealed' by being stabbed with the same blood dagger that sealed their powers, a process that is extremely painful. Once 'unsealed', Dire do not age and can breed at any point."

    "Line 1" : "Aureliae is well-loved by her citizens and is known for being generous to her subjects. She rewards loyalty with a night together in bed and is known for her charisma and ability to sway opinions in her favor. Despite this, the Empyrean Royal Church of the 6 Devines oppose her rule of The Kingdom Sakura no Koku and hunt other Dire for their blood or Blood Daggers. However, Aureliae is diplomatically immune to their hunters due to her position as empress.",
    "Line 2" : "Aureliae is known for her distinctive appearance, wearing a lewd silver armor with an open belly and back, small silver pauldrons, tall heels, an armored bra-like chest piece, knee-high lace stockings, silver claw-like gauntlets, and a crown adorned with gold and rubies. In her personal armory, she keeps a blood-enchanted silver katana that was smithed by the best blacksmith in Starmoor using her own blood.",
    "Line 3" : "In her free time, Aureliae enjoys romantic interactions with the blood dragons in her service, who can switch between their dragon form and a very feminine human form at will. Despite her busy schedule, she takes time to bed with her harem and relax. Aureliae's mentor, Gamio Westing, a wealthy human, helped her when she was a young orphaned Dire and unsealed her powers, leading to her eventual overthrow of the previous emperor in a 1v1 fight. Gamio has since passed away, but Aureliae still values the lessons she learned from him.",
    "Line 4" : "Aureliae's kingdom is a safe haven for both pure blood demons who detest the racial supremacy in other kingdoms and hybrids of both demon and human who seek asylum, as well as humans looking for a strong and stable place to live. Its mild climate and abundant resources make it an attractive destination for immigrants, leading to the growth of small towns into cities. Despite facing opposition from other kingdoms, Aureliae's rule provides a buffer between her kingdom and those ruled by pure blood demons, preventing potential turmoil and fighting."
